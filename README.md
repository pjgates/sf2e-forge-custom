# SF2e Forge Custom Rules

Custom rules and homebrew modifications for the **Starfinder Second Edition** system in [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

## Features

### Players Roll All Dice (PRAD)

A variant rule that puts dice in the players' hands for every roll:

- **NPC attacks become player armor saves** -- instead of the GM rolling to hit, the targeted player rolls a save against the NPC's attack DC.
- **NPC saves become player overcome checks** -- instead of the GM rolling saves for NPCs, the caster rolls an overcome check against each target's save DC.
- **Sheet augmentation** -- NPC sheets display DCs, and PC sheets display corresponding modifiers, so the right numbers are always visible.

### Target Helper

Per-target save/check rows on chat cards for spells, area effects, and other targeted actions:

- Adds a row for each targeted token directly on the chat card.
- Players and GMs can roll saves or apply results per target.
- Integrates with PRAD to support overcome checks.
- Compatible with [PF2e Toolbelt](https://github.com/reonZ/pf2e-toolbelt)'s Target Helper -- when Toolbelt is active, this module only handles PRAD-specific cards.
