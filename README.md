# Codex Bridge

Obsidian↔Foundry VTT bridge: campaign content sync (**codex-sync**) plus opt-in rules for **Pathfinder Second Edition** and **Starfinder Second Edition** in [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

> **Renamed from `sf2e-forge-custom` in v1.0.0.** Migration steps: see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md#100).

## Features

### Codex Sync (Vault Sync)

Campaign content (entities, creatures, art) flows from an external Obsidian vault into Foundry at runtime — no compendium packs. The push pipeline builds an encrypted payload from vault markdown and rsyncs it to the server; worlds with Vault Sync enabled pull it from the GM's sync dialog.

### Players Roll All Dice (PRAD)

A variant rule that puts dice in the players' hands for every roll:

- **NPC attacks become player armor saves** — instead of the GM rolling to hit, the targeted player rolls a save against the NPC's attack DC.
- **NPC saves become player overcome checks** — instead of the GM rolling saves for NPCs, the caster rolls an overcome check against each target's save DC.
- **Sheet augmentation** — NPC sheets display DCs, and PC sheets display corresponding modifiers, so the right numbers are always visible.

### Heroic Rerolls

An optional Hero Point variant rule: when a Hero Point rerolls a d20 below 10, the die result becomes 10.

### Target Helper

Per-target save/check rows on chat cards for spells, area effects, and other targeted actions:

- Adds a row for each targeted token directly on the chat card.
- Players and GMs can roll saves or apply results per target.
- Integrates with PRAD to support overcome checks.
- Compatible with [PF2e Toolbelt](https://github.com/reonZ/pf2e-toolbelt)'s Target Helper — when Toolbelt is active, this module only handles PRAD-specific cards.

### Gridless Combat

An optional setting for PF2e and SF2e gridless scenes. Gridded scenes keep their native behavior.

- Distances use continuous Euclidean geometry without rounding. Large tokens retain PF2e occupied-space reach.
- Native flanking rules remain active. A wall that blocks all five target rays also blocks flanking.
- With one controlled creature and one target, red wedges extend from the target center to the valid flanking arc.
- The outer arc uses native flanking checks. The interior fill indicates direction only.
- An eligible ally must already be within reach. The guide preserves native flanking feats and excludes wall-blocked positions.
- Automatic cover samples the target center and four corners from the attacker center. Movement-blocking walls provide the obstruction.
- A creature across the center line provides lesser cover (+1 AC).
- Terrain that blocks corner rays but leaves the center visible provides light cover (+1 AC).
- Terrain that blocks the center but leaves a corner visible provides standard cover (+2 AC and area Reflex).
- All five blocked rays prevent the attack or save. Native Take Cover effects provide greater cover without stacking circumstance bonuses.
- Native area shapes remain continuous. Area placement selects visible targets inside the shape with at least one clear wall ray.
- Area saves use the placed shape as their origin. If an item has multiple areas, select the relevant area before the save.
- The remaining-Stride ring appears only for one selected token during movement or while the **Preview Movement Ring** shortcut is held.
- Selecting multiple tokens hides movement rings, including held previews.
- The shortcut is unassigned by default. Assign it under **Configure Controls → Codex Foundry → Preview Movement Ring**.
- Ready attacks add colored distance overlays: filled melee-reach circles and outline-only ranged circles. They use the same movement/hold-preview visibility.
- Ranged circles show the first range increment, or the fixed maximum when an attack has no increment.
- Equal distances of the same kind share a circle with combined attack labels.
- Attack overlays show the listed distances from the token center. Attack resolution still uses native target-specific rules.
- During its turn, recorded movement costs reduce the remaining distance. Crossing a Stride limit advances to the next action increment.
- Drag previews include the planned path. Canceling a drag restores the recorded budget, and the next turn resets movement history.
- This is a movement-only indicator. Attacks and other non-movement actions do not consume its budget.
- Outside the token's turn, only the current drag preview consumes the displayed allowance.
- Ring outlines remain straight-line previews. They do not predict walls or future terrain costs.
- Movement budgets require native history recording. PF2e Toolbelt's per-user **Better Movement → No History Record** option must be off.

Automatic cover is this module's geometric approximation, not native PF2e/SF2e automation. Region outlines do not clip to walls.

## Compatibility

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Foundry VTT | v14 |
| SF2e System | 0.0.4+ |
| PF2e System | 8.5.0+ |

Gridless integration targets Foundry 14.367, PF2e 8.5.0, and SF2e 1.5.0.

## Installation

1. In Foundry VTT, go to **Add-on Modules** and click **Install Module**.
2. Paste the following manifest URL into the bottom field:

```
https://github.com/pjgates/codex-bridge/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

3. Click **Install** and enable the module in your world.

## Configuration

Found under **Module Settings > Codex Foundry**. All settings are world-scoped (GM only) except the Vault Sync Passphrase, which is client-scoped by design — it lives in the GM's browser localStorage and is never replicated to other clients.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Enable Custom Rules** | Master switch for the entire module. Requires reload. | On |
| **Enable Target Helper** | Adds per-target rows to chat cards. Requires reload. | On |
| **Heroic Rerolls** | Raises Hero Point d20 rerolls below 10 to 10. Requires reload. | Off |
| **Gridless Combat** | Continuous geometry, automatic cover, area targeting, flanking guides, and remaining-movement rings. Requires reload. | Off |
| **Players Roll All Dice** | Enables the PRAD variant. Requires Target Helper to be on. | Off |
| **Strict DC Mode (Exact Probabilities)** | Uses DC = 12 + modifier instead of 11 + modifier under PRAD, exactly preserving original probabilities. | Off |
| **Statblock Importer** | Adds an Import Statblock button to the Actors sidebar (GM only). | On |
| **Enable Vault Sync** | Fetch vault content pushed to `Data/codex-sync`. Requires reload. | On |
| **Vault Sync Passphrase** | Decrypts the pushed payload. Client-scoped (this browser only). | — |

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.13+
- A local Foundry VTT installation
- `gitleaks` (e.g. `brew install gitleaks`) — the pre-commit hook in `.githooks/` (auto-wired by `npm install`) blocks sensitive paths and scans staged changes for secrets; this repo is public.

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pjgates/codex-bridge.git
cd codex-bridge
npm install
```

### Build

```bash
# One-time build (Vite → dist/)
npm run build

# Watch mode (rebuilds on file changes)
npm run watch
```

### Vault sync (codex-sync)

The push pipeline lives in `sync/` and reads markdown from an external Obsidian vault.

1. Copy `codex-sync.config.example.json` to `codex-sync.config.json` and set `vaultPath`, `campaign`, and `remote`.
2. Put `CODEX_SYNC_PASSPHRASE` in `.env` (never commit).
3. Dry-run the build:

```bash
npm run push -- --dry-run
```

4. Push to the server:

```bash
npm run push
```

`npm run verify` runs typecheck, lint, tests, and `vite build`.

### Link to Foundry

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)" "<foundryData>/Data/modules/codex-foundry"
```

### Layout

- `src/` — Foundry module (`src/sync/` pull-side; `src/rulesets/sf2e/` houserules; `src/shared/`, `src/hooks/`)
- `sync/` — push-side CLI (`sync/push.ts`, `sync/lib/`, `sync/converter/`)
- `tests/node/` — node-side feature tests (template/fixture access)
