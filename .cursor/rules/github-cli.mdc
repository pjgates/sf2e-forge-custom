# GitHub CLI Usage

When the user provides a GitHub URL or asks about GitHub resources (PRs, issues, repos, releases, etc.), **always use the `gh` CLI** instead of web-fetching or browser tools.

## Resolving GitHub URLs

Parse the URL to determine the resource type and use the matching `gh` command:

| URL pattern | Command |
|---|---|
| `github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/NUMBER` | `gh pr view NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO` |
| `github.com/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER` | `gh issue view NUMBER -R OWNER/REPO` |
| `github.com/OWNER/REPO` | `gh repo view OWNER/REPO` |
| `github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases` | `gh release list -R OWNER/REPO` |
| `github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/tag/TAG` | `gh release view TAG -R OWNER/REPO` |
| `github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs/ID` | `gh run view ID -R OWNER/REPO` |

## Key commands

### Pull Requests
- `gh pr view NUMBER` — view PR details (title, body, status, reviews)
- `gh pr list` — list open PRs
- `gh pr checks NUMBER` — show CI status
- `gh pr diff NUMBER` — view the diff
- `gh pr create` — create a PR
- `gh pr checkout NUMBER` — check out a PR branch locally
- `gh pr comment NUMBER -b "text"` — add a comment
- `gh pr merge NUMBER` — merge a PR

### Issues
- `gh issue view NUMBER` — view issue details
- `gh issue list` — list open issues
- `gh issue create` — create an issue
- `gh issue comment NUMBER -b "text"` — add a comment

### Repositories
- `gh repo view OWNER/REPO` — view repo info
- `gh repo clone OWNER/REPO` — clone a repo

### API (for anything not covered above)
- `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments` — read PR review comments
- `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments` — read issue comments
- `gh api ENDPOINT --jq 'QUERY'` — extract specific fields with jq

### Releases & Actions
- `gh release list` — list releases
- `gh release view TAG` — view a specific release
- `gh run list` — list workflow runs
- `gh run view ID` — view a specific run

## Cross-repo flag

When the target repo differs from the current working directory, always pass `-R OWNER/REPO`.

## Prefer structured output

Use `--json FIELDS` and `--jq QUERY` flags to get machine-readable output when you need to extract specific data:

```bash
gh pr view 123 --json title,body,state,reviews
gh issue list --json number,title,labels --jq '.[] | "\(.number): \(.title)"'
```
